    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dense(len(label_encoder.classes_), activation='softmax')  # Output layer with number of classes
])
Sequential([...]): This creates a Sequential model object. A Sequential model is appropriate for a plain stack of layers where each layer has exactly one input tensor and one output tensor.
Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],)): This line adds a fully connected (Dense) layer with 128 units to the model.
128: This specifies the number of neurons in the layer.
activation='relu': This specifies the activation function for the layer, which is Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU). ReLU is commonly used in hidden layers of neural networks to introduce non-linearity.
input_shape=(X_train.shape[1],): This specifies the shape of the input data to the layer. X_train.shape[1] is the number of features in the training data, so this line defines the input layer with the same number of input features.
Dense(64, activation='relu'): This line adds another fully connected (Dense) layer with 64 units to the model.
64: This specifies the number of neurons in the layer.
activation='relu': This specifies the activation function for the layer, which is ReLU.
Dense(len(label_encoder.classes_), activation='softmax'): This line adds the output layer to the model.
len(label_encoder.classes_): This specifies the number of units in the output layer, which is equal to the number of unique classes in the target variable. label_encoder.classes_ contains the unique classes encoded earlier.
activation='softmax': This specifies the activation function for the output layer, which is Softmax. Softmax is commonly used in multi-class classification problems to convert the output of the model into probability scores for each class.
So, after these lines of code, you'll have constructed a neural network model with three Dense layers: an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer.

'sparse_categorical_crossentropy' is used for multi-class classification problems where the target labels are provided as integers. It calculates the cross-entropy loss between the true labels and the predicted probabilities.
metrics=['accuracy']: This specifies the evaluation metric(s) to be monitored during training and testing. Here, 'accuracy' is specified, which calculates the accuracy of the model on the training and validation data during training and on the test data during testing.
So, after this line of code, the model is compiled with the specified optimizer, loss function, and evaluation metric(s), and it's ready to be trained on the training data.

X_train: This is the input features (independent variables) for training the model.
y_train: This is the target variable (dependent variable) for training the model.
epochs=20: This parameter specifies the number of epochs, i.e., the number of times the entire dataset will be passed forward and backward through the neural network during training. Here, it's set to 20, meaning the training process will iterate over the entire dataset 20 times.
batch_size=32: This parameter specifies the number of samples per gradient update. In each epoch, the dataset will be divided into batches, and each batch will be used to update the model's weights once. Here, it's set to 32, meaning 32 samples will be processed before a weight update is performed.
validation_split=0.2: This parameter specifies the fraction of the training data to be used as validation data. In this case, 20% of the training data will be used for validation during training. The model's performance on the validation data will be monitored to detect overfitting.
During training, the model will go through each epoch, dividing the training data into batches, calculating the loss, and updating the model's weights based on the optimizer's algorithm. The validation data will be used to evaluate the model's performance after each epoch, allowing for monitoring of both training and validation metrics.

python
Copy code
print("Test Accuracy:", test_accuracy)
print("Test Accuracy:", test_accuracy): This line prints out the test accuracy of the model on the test data. It displays the test accuracy value obtained from the evaluation of the model on the test set.

explain each line
ChatGPT
Sure, let's break down the prediction process:

python
Copy code

model.predict(...): This method is used to make predictions using the trained model. It takes input data (X_test in this case) and produces predictions based on the learned relationships between the input features and the target variable.
X_test: This is the input features (independent variables) for which predictions are being made. It represents the unseen data on which the model's performance is being evaluated.
The predict method returns predictions for each input sample in the test set. In this case, predictions will contain the predicted values for each sample in X_test.

So, after this line of code, predictions will contain the model's predictions for the input test data. These predictions can be used for further analysis, evaluation, or any other relevant tasks.

explain each line
ChatGPT
Sure, let's break down the decoding process:

np.argmax(predictions, axis=1): This line finds the index of the maximum value along the specified axis (axis 1, which corresponds to columns) in the predictions array. This effectively finds the predicted class label for each sample in the test set.
label_encoder.inverse_transform(...): This line reverses the transformation performed by the label encoder earlier. It converts the numerical labels back into their original categorical form.
So, np.argmax(predictions, axis=1) identifies the index of the maximum value in each prediction array, and label_encoder.inverse_transform(...) converts these indices back into their original categorical labels. The result, predicted_labels, contains the predicted labels in their original categorical form, ready for comparison with the true labels for evaluation.

y_test: This variable contains the encoded target variable (dependent variable) for the test set. These are the actual labels encoded using the label encoder.
So, label_encoder.inverse_transform(y_test) converts the encoded numerical labels back into their original categorical labels, resulting in actual_labels containing the actual labels in their original categorical form. These are the ground truth labels against which the model's predictions will be compared for evaluation.
